# RushEd
A career-match app that takes user preferences and strengths, suggests next steps towards a chosen career, and keeps track of progress.

## Motivation

This project is part of UW Continuing Education Coding Bootcamp. It's creators are so-called mature students, and have a good number of other qualifications and experiences under their belts--all of them ultimately inadequate to our long-term needs and interests.

Our stories and the paths that brought us here are not uncommon. Few highschoolers know exactly what they want, or have the benefit of an insightful and impartial counsellor. Instead, most of us are asked to choose a degree or a line of work long before we know much about ourselves, or the professional world that awaits us. We settle on what's familiar, or affordable, or expected. Then, we can spend years trying to make that one rash decision work, often with no resources to change the course.

RushEd can fill the gap in the decision-making process for young people choosing their next steps, and help them stay on track.
